This is very short introduction how to build source code of OpenCV Marker less AR

1. Install OpenCV
Please install OpenCV 2.3 or later.
You can download it from this site.  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/

To install it, please follow the instruction of this site.
http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide

2. Install GLUT
Please install GLUT 3.7.6 or later.
You can download it from this site.  
http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/


3. Install libpng and zlib
To use GLMetaseq, you need these libraries. If you build OpenCV from source code, you can find these libraries in OpenCV.


4. Create new project
Please create new project of your IDE and import all source files of OpenCV Marker less AR


5. Add include directory path to your project
You need to add include path of each libarary to your project.
For example, OpenCV2.3.1 include path on Windows is usually:
C:\OpenCV2.3.1\include

If you use Visual C++, you can specify its path at
Property of Project -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional include Directories:


6. Link libraries
You need to link each libraries to your project.
About OpenCV, you need the following lib files.
- opencv_core
- opencv_imgproc
- opencv_highgui
- opencv_calib3d
- opencv_video231
- opencv_features2d

If you use Visual C++, you can specify the libraries to link at
Property of Project -> Linker -> General -> Additional library Directories: 
Property of Project -> Linker -> Input -> Additonal Dependencies (debug):
Property of Project -> Linker -> Input -> Additonal Dependencies (release):
